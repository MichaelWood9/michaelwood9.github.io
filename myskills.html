                    <h3 id="skill-logo">Java</h3>
                    <p>I developed this skill throughout my time at university with modules such Data structures and algorithms and Operating Systems. Though these modules I learn the fundamentals of programming and the Java syntax as well as object-oriented programming. I have also been developing this skill further by reading the Learn Java with projects book by Dr Sean Kennedy and Maaike Van Putten. I have been going through this book and completing the exercises and projects in the book honed my skill within Java. I am also beginning to research the Java Spring boot framework so I can rapidly develop different types of applications using Java and integrate a database using PostgreSQL.</p>

                    <h3 id="skill-logo">Python</h3>
                    <p>I developed this skill by self-learning, creating my own projects and though my university course. In my final year project at university, I developed an electric vehicle routing algorithm which was written in python and ran on the SUMO traffic simulator. Though this project I updated my skills in python and wrote and used the A* algorithm to create a new route for an electric vehicle with charging stops. I plan to also create a discord bot in python that makes use of the discord API.</p>

                    <h3 id="skill-logo">C</h3>
                    <p>I worked with C though out my Embedded systems module. I developed many programs in C to run on the PIC16F882 microcontroller. A project I worked on with C is a temperature monitoring program which used a temperature module on the board for the PIC16F882 microcontroller and I used C to display the temperature converted to Celsius or Fahrenheit  on the LCD display.</p>

                    <h3 id="skill-logo">Problem solving</h3>
                    <p>This skill I gained by working through my university course and my time at Tesco. During my final year project this skill was essential. I had to overcome problems when using Python along with the SUMO traffic simulator where I had to figure out how to use the TraCi Python library to interact with vehicles on the traffic simulator. For example, setting the calculated route for the Electric vehicle to take. During my time at Tesco as a personal shopper I had to help customers and colleagues with issues they had. Overtime these situations became easier for me due to my problem-solving skills improving.</p>

                    <h3 id="skill-logo">Communication</h3>
                    <p>I developed my communication skills throughout my Time at Tesco and my team project modules at university. At Tesco I fostered excellent communication skills working with other members of the team and customers. During my team projects good communication was essential to the success of these projects where we scored 100% and 72% in the modules. In the projects I was nominated to be team leader and in this role insured everyone knew what they were doing and each other are doing to avoid any confusion in the work. I also encouraged the team to tell the team if they were having any issues so that we could help them solve these issues as a team. This ensure that we could complete the project to the best of our abilities.</p>
