                <p>I am a highly motivated computer science graduate who has first class honours from the University of Huddersfield. I have experience working with the agile methodology designing and developing programs in Java, Python and C at university. I also have experience with effective communication, leadership and problem solving from my experience at Tesco.</p>

                <p>I am seeking a software development/engineering position where I can develop effective solutions utilising my current skillset. I am always looking to upskill and adapt to new situations I encounter to overcome them and improve my skills so I can effectively navigate future challenges.</p>

                        <p>This is a website I developed as part of Couch2Coder 2024 course. The goal of this project was to develop a portfolio site to showcase my skills and projects.  Developing this site solidified the skills I developed from the Couch2Coder course. I made use of HTML to develop the content for the site such as placing images and the text and the basic layout of the site. I also made use of CSS to enhance the layout and look of my site.</p>
                        <h4>What I learnt:</h4>
                        <p>I learnt how I develop a structured well designed website making use custom CSS for layout and design. I also the used of different HTML tags such as articles, divs and uls.</p>

                        <h4>Description of Project:</h4>
                        <p>This is a Java CLI program which I developed using the skills I developed in university and been improving using the learn java with projects book by Dr Sean Kennedy and Maaike Van Putten. The idea of this project came from the learn java with projects book. The project is a management system for a Dinosaur Park (similar to Jurassic Park). In this project I developed Dinosaur management systems to add/remove dinosaurs from the park and edit dinosaur properties such as their age, name and enclosure. Aswell as a management system for the employees where you can add, remove and edit employees including adding a work schedule for the employees.</p>
                        <h4>What I learnt:</h4>
                        <p>I learnt a lot from undertaking this project such as enhancing my object-oriented programming (OOP) skills. I made use of multiple different class such as Dinosaur and Employee following OOP rules such as encapsulation. These classes had multiple methods for editing the objects created by the class.</p>

                        <h4>Description of Project:</h4>
                        <p>This is C project to run on board with a PIC16F882 microcontroller that I built in my embedded systems module during my second year at university. The program takes data from the temperature module on the board and converts it into Celsius and Fahrenheit and displays it on the LCD screen. There is also an LED light bar on the board and the program lights up the bar to match the current temperature.

                        <h4>What I learnt:</h4>
                        <p>I learnt many things undertaking this project as part of my embedded system module at university. Firstly, in this project I solidified my embedded programming in C which I had been learning throughout the university module. I learnt how to use timers and interrupts within my program effectively. </p>
